What are the different arcane traditions in wizardry and how do they affect a wizard's study and spellcasting abilities?,"['\n\nWhen you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\nIf you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.\n\nArcane Traditions\n\nThe study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.\n\nThe most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.\n\nSchool of Evocation\n\nYou focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.\n\nEvocation Savant\n\nBeginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.\n\nSculpt Spells\n\nBeginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.\n\nPotent Cantrip\n\nStarting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.\n\nEmpowered Evocation\n\nBeginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.\n\nOverchannel\n\nStarting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.\n\nThe first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.\n\nYour Spellbook\n\nThe spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.\n\nCopying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.\n\nCopying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.\n\nFor each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.\n']","The most common arcane traditions in wizardry are the schools of magic. These traditions categorize spells into eight different schools. Wizards who study these traditions can specialize in a specific school, such as the School of Illusion or the School of Enchantment. The different arcane traditions affect a wizard's study and spellcasting abilities by providing unique benefits and features. For example, the School of Evocation focuses on elemental effects and allows wizards to create pockets of safety within their spells. Other traditions, such as the School of Abjuration or the School of Divination, offer different abilities and advantages to wizards who specialize in them. These arcane traditions provide a framework for wizards to learn and master different techniques and spells.",simple,"[{'source': 'data/02 classes.md', 'filename': 'data/02 classes.md'}]",True

As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\n\nSorcerous Restoration\n\nAt 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.\n\nSorcerous Origins\n\nDifferent sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a draconic bloodline and wild magic.\n\nDraconic Bloodline\n\nYour innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.\n\nDragon Ancestor\n\nAt 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.\n\nDraconic Ancestry\n\nDragon Damage Type Black Acid Blue Lightning Brass Fire Bronze Lightning Copper Acid Gold Fire Green Poison Red Fire Silver Cold White Cold\n\nYou can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.\n\nDraconic Resilience\n\nAs magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.\n\nAdditionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.\n\nElemental Affinity\n\nStarting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.\n\nDragon Wings\n\nAt 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.\n\nYou can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.\n\nDraconic Presence\n\nBeginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends.

Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.\n\nPath of the Berserker\n\nFor some barbarians, rage is a means to an end— that end being violence.

If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.\n\nIntimidating Presence\n\nBeginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.\n\nIf the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.\n\nRetaliation\n\nStarting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.\n\nBard\n\nClass Features\n\nAs a bard, you gain the following class features.\n\nHit Points\n\nHit Dice: 1d8 per bard level\n\nHit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier\n\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per bard level after 1st\n\nProficiencies\n\nArmor: Light armor\n\nWeapons: Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords\n\nTools: Three musical instruments of your choice\n\nSaving Throws: Dexterity, Charisma\n\nSkills: Choose any three\n\nEquipment\n\nYou start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n\n(a) a rapier, (b) a longsword, or (c) any simple weapon\n\n(a) a diplomat’s pack or (b) an entertainer’']","Starting at 11th level, the Relentless Rage feature allows a barbarian to keep fighting despite grievous wounds.

What are some of the Celtic gods and their associated domains?,"['Appendix PH-B: Fantasy-Historical Pantheons\n\nThe Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fantasy interpretations of historical religions from our world’s ancient times. They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a game, divorced from their historical context in the real world and united into pantheons that serve the needs of the game.\n\nThe Celtic Pantheon\n\nIt’s said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak—and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from the brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.\n\nThe Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.\n\nCeltic Deities\n\nDeity Alignment Suggested Domains Symbol The Daghdha, god of weather and crops CG Nature, Trickery Bubbling cauldron or shield Arawn, god of life and death NE Life, Death Black star on gray background Belenus, god of sun, light, and warmth NG Light Solar disk and standing stones Brigantia, goddess of rivers and livestock NG Life Footbridge Diancecht, god of medicine and healing LG Life Crossed oak and mistletoe branches Dunatis, god of mountains and peaks N Nature Red sun-capped mountain peak Goibhniu, god of smiths and healing NG Knowledge, Life Giant mallet over sword Lugh, god of arts, travel, and commerce CN Knowledge, Life Pair of long hands Manannan mac Lir, god of oceans and sea creatures LN Nature, Tempest Wave of white water on green Math Mathonwy, god of magic NE Knowledge Staff Morrigan, goddess of battle CE War Two crossed spears Nuada, god of war and warriors N War Silver hand on black background Oghma, god of speech and writing NG Knowledge Unfurled scroll Silvanus, god of nature and forests N Nature Summer oak tree\n\nThe Greek Pantheon\n\nThe gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of waves against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the cloud-enshrouded peaks. The thick boar-infested woods and the sere, olive-covered hillsides hold evidence of their passing. Every aspect of nature echoes with their presence, and they’ve made a place for themselves inside the human heart, too.\n\nGreek Deities\n\nDeity Alignment Suggested Domains Symbol Zeus, god of the sky, ruler of the gods N Tempest Fist full of lightning bolts Aphrodite, goddess of love and beauty CG Light Sea shell Apollo, god of light, music, and healing CG Knowledge, Life, Light Lyre Ares, god of war and strife CE War Spear Artemis, goddess of hunting and childbirth NG Life, Nature Bow and arrow on lunar disk Athena, goddess of wisdom and civilization LG Knowledge, War Owl Demeter, goddess of agriculture NG Life Mare’s head Dionysus, god of mirth and wine CN Life Thyrsus (staff tipped with pine cone) Hades, god of the underworld LE Death Black ram Hecate, goddess of magic and the moon CE Knowledge, Trickery Setting moon Hephaestus, god of smithing and craft NG Knowledge Hammer and anvil Hera, goddess of marriage and intrigue CN Trickery Fan of peacock feathers Hercules, god of strength and adventure CG Tempest, War Lion’s head Hermes, god of travel and commerce CG Trickery Caduceus (winged staff and serpents) Hestia, goddess of home and family NG Life Hearth Nike, goddess of victory LN War Winged woman Pan, god of nature CN Nature Syrinx (pan pipes) Poseidon, god of the sea and earthquakes CN Tempest Trident Tyche, goddess of good fortune N Trickery Red pentagram\n\nThe Egyptian Pantheon\n\nThese gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the rulership of the cosmos and the maintenance of the divine principle of Ma’at—the fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and women in their logical and rightful place in the universe.\n\nThe Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three gods responsible for death, each with different alignments.
