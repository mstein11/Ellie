What are the different arcane traditions in wizardry and how do they affect a wizard's study and spellcasting abilities?,"[""Wizard\n======\nArcane Traditions\n-----------------\n\nThe study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.\n\nThe most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding.

You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.\n\n### Arcane Tradition\n\nWhen you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.\n\nYour choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.\n\n"", ""Wizard\n======\nArcane Traditions\n-----------------\n### Your Spellbook\n\nThe spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse.

They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.\n\n**Necromancy** spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.\n\nCreating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as *animate dead* is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.\n\n""]","The most common arcane traditions in wizardry are the schools of magic. These traditions categorize spells into eight different schools. Wizards who study these traditions can specialize in a specific school, such as the School of Illusion or the School of Enchantment. The different arcane traditions affect a wizard's study and spellcasting abilities by providing unique benefits and features. For example, the School of Evocation focuses on elemental effects and allows wizards to create pockets of safety within their spells. Other traditions, such as the School of Abjuration or the School of Divination, offer different abilities and advantages to wizards who specialize in them.

Each school requires mastery of different techniques and spells, directing the wizard's research and spellcasting focus.\n\n- **Class Features**: Each arcane tradition grants specific features at 2nd level and additional benefits at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels. This allows wizards to enhance their abilities and specialize in a particular style of magic.\n\n- **Spell Acquisition**: The spells added to a wizard's spellbook reflect the arcane research and breakthroughs related to their chosen school. This specialization can streamline the process of learning spells, such as the **Evocation Savant** feature, which halves the cost and time to copy evocation spells into their spellbook.\n\nOverall, these traditions not only define the types of spells a wizard can focus on but also influence their development and skills as spellcasters throughout their journey.""","['\n\nWhen you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort.

When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.\n\nPotent Cantrip\n\nStarting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.\n\nEmpowered Evocation\n\nBeginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.\n\nOverchannel\n\nStarting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.\n\nThe first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.\n\nYour Spellbook\n\nThe spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse.

You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.\n\nFor each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.

As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\n\nSorcerous Restoration\n\nAt 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.\n\nSorcerous Origins\n\nDifferent sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a draconic bloodline and wild magic.\n\nDraconic Bloodline\n\nYour innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.\n\nDragon Ancestor\n\nAt 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.\n\nDraconic Ancestry\n\nDragon Damage Type Black Acid Blue Lightning Brass Fire Bronze Lightning Copper Acid Gold Fire Green Poison Red Fire Silver Cold White Cold\n\nYou can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.\n\nDraconic Resilience\n\nAs magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.\n\nAdditionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.\n\nElemental Affinity\n\nStarting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.\n\nDragon Wings\n\nAt 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.\n\nYou can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.\n\nDraconic Presence\n\nBeginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.\n\nWarlock\n\nClass Features\n\nAs a warlock, you gain the following class features.\n\nHit Points\n\nHit Dice: 1d8 per warlock level\n\nHit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier\n\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per warlock level after 1st\n\nProficiencies\n\nArmor: Light armor\n\nWeapons: Simple weapons\n\nTools: None\n\nSaving Throws: Wisdom, Charisma\n\nSkills: Choose two skills from Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, and Religion\n\nEquipment\n\nYou start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n- (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon\n- (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus\n- (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) a dungeoneer’s pack\n- Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers\n\nThe Warlock\n\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Features Cantrips Known Spells Known Spell Slots Slot Level']"

If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nFor example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots.

Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw.

The GM answers each question with one word, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or “unclear” (if the entity doesn’t know the answer to the question).

On a hit, you afflict the creature with a disease of your choice from any of the ones described below.\n\nAt the end of each of the target’s turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. After failing three of these saving throws, the disease’s effects last for the duration, and the creature stops making these saves. After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the creature recovers from the disease, and the spell ends.\n\nSince this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease’s effects apply to it.\n\nBlinding Sickness. Pain grips the creature’s mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.\n\nFilth Fever.
