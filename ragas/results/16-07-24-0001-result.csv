What is the advantage of having advantage on an ability check?,"['Using Ability Scores\n====================\nAdvantage and Disadvantage\n--------------------------\n\nSometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.\n\nIf multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.\n\n'
 'Using Ability Scores\n====================\nAdvantage and Disadvantage\n--------------------------\nIf circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.\n\nWhen you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.\n\nYou usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The\n\nGM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.\n\n'
 'Using Ability Scores\n====================\nProficiency Bonus\n-----------------\nBy the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.\n\nIn general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.\n\n'
 'Using Ability Scores\n====================\nProficiency Bonus\n-----------------\n\nCharacters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.\n\nYour proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.\n\nOccasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.\n\n'
 'Using Ability Scores\n====================\nAbility Checks\n--------------\n### Working Together\n\nSometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who’s leading the effort—or the one with the highest ability modifier—can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.\n\nA character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.\n\n']",Having advantage on an ability check allows the creature to roll two d20s and take the higher result. This increases the chances of success for the ability check.,simple,"[{'source': 'data/12 conditions.md', 'filename': 'data/12 conditions.md'}]",True,"b'When you have advantage on an ability check in Dungeons and Dragons, you roll a second d20 and use the higher of the two rolls. This can increase your chances of success on the ability check.'","['Appendix PH-A: Conditions\n\nConditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.\n\nA condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.\n\nIf multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.\n\nThe following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.\n\nBlinded\n\nA blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.\n\nAttack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.\n\nCharmed\n\nA charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.\n\nThe charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.\n\nDeafened\n\nA deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.\n\nExhaustion\n\nSome special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.\n\nLevel Effect 1 Disadvantage on ability checks 2 Speed halved 3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws 4 Hit point maximum halved 5 Speed reduced to 0 6 Death\n\nIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.\n\nA creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.\n\nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\n\nFinishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.\n\nFrightened\n\nA frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.\n\nThe creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.\n\nGrappled\n\nA grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.\n\nThe condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).\n\nThe condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunder-wave spell.\n\nIncapacitated\n\nAn incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.\n\nInvisible\n\nAn invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.\n\nAttack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage.\n\nParalyzed\n\nA paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can’t move or speak.\n\nThe creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.\n\nAttack rolls against the creature have advantage.\n\nAny attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.\n\nPetrified\n\nA petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.\n\nThe creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.\n\nAttack rolls against the creature have advantage.\n\nThe creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.\n\nThe creature has resistance to all damage.\n\nThe creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.\n\nPoisoned\n\nA poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\n\nProne\n\nA prone creature’s only movement option is to']",0.94999999997625,1.0,0.930706207229896,0.5
What is the effect of using the Overchannel feature when casting wizard spells?,"['Wizard\n======\nArcane Traditions\n-----------------\n### School of Evocation\n#### Overchannel\n\nStarting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.\n\nThe first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.\n\n'
 'Beyond 1st Level\n================\nMulticlassing\n-------------\n### Multiclassing Class Features\n#### Spellcasting\n***Spell Slots.*** You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.\n\nIf you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like *burning hands*, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don’t have any spells of that higher level.\n\n'
 'Beyond 1st Level\n================\nMulticlassing\n-------------\n### Multiclassing Class Features\n#### Spellcasting\nFor example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don’t know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know—and potentially enhance their effects.\n\n***Pact Magic.*** If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.\n\n'
 'Wizard\n======\nClass Features\n--------------\n### Ability Score Improvement\n\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\n\n### Spell Mastery\n\nAt 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.\n\nBy spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.\n\n'
 'Beyond 1st Level\n================\nMulticlassing\n-------------\n### Multiclassing Class Features\n\nWhen you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.\n\n#### Channel Divinity\n\nIf you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.\n\n']","When using the Overchannel feature, the power of simpler spells can be increased. The first time this feature is used, there are no adverse effects. However, if it is used again before a long rest, the caster takes 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell immediately after casting it. Each subsequent use of this feature before a long rest increases the necrotic damage per spell level by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.",simple,"[{'source': 'data/02 classes.md', 'filename': 'data/02 classes.md'}]",True,"b'When you utilize the Overchannel feature while casting spells as a wizard, you can deal maximum damage with the spell if it is of 1st through 5th level. However, if you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, you will take necrotic damage equal to 2d12 for each level of the spell immediately after casting it. Each subsequent use of this feature before finishing a long rest increases the necrotic damage per spell level by 1d12. This necrotic damage ignores resistance and immunity.'","['\n\nWhen you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\nIf you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.\n\nArcane Traditions\n\nThe study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.\n\nThe most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.\n\nSchool of Evocation\n\nYou focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.\n\nEvocation Savant\n\nBeginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.\n\nSculpt Spells\n\nBeginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.\n\nPotent Cantrip\n\nStarting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.\n\nEmpowered Evocation\n\nBeginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.\n\nOverchannel\n\nStarting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.\n\nThe first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.\n\nYour Spellbook\n\nThe spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.\n\nCopying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.\n\nCopying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.\n\nFor each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.\n']",0.7499999999625,1.0,0.9737618664000007,1.0
What are the benefits of favored terrain in the ranger class?,"['Ranger\n======\nClass Features\n--------------\n### Natural Explorer\nWhile traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:\n- Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.\n- Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.\n- Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.\n- If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.\n- When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.\n- While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.\n\nYou choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.\n\n'

See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.\n\nSpell Slots\n\nThe Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\n\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.\n\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher\n\nYou know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.\n\nThe Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\n\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\n\nSpellcasting Ability\n\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\n\nRanger Archetype\n\nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.\n\nPrimeval Awareness\n\nBeginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.\n\nSome patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.\n\n'
 'Warlock\n=======\nOtherworldly Patrons\n--------------------\n### The Fiend\n\nYou have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.\n\n'

Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock.

 'Using Ability Scores\n====================\nProficiency Bonus\n-----------------\n\nCharacters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.\n\nYour proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.\n\nOccasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.\n\n'

 'Druid\n=====\nClass Features\n--------------\n### Sacred Plants and Wood\n\nA druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.\n\nSimilarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.\n\nDruids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.\n\n'
 'Druid\n=====\nClass Features\n--------------\n### Druids and the Gods\n\nSome druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities).

These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic.

At 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense the druid's connection to nature and become hesitant to attack them. When a beast or plant creature attacks the druid, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against the druid's spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours. 

In addition, druids hold certain plants and woods as sacred, such as alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. They often use these plants as part of their spellcasting focus or to make objects like weapons and shields. The choice of plants and woods can have different associations and uses, such as yew being associated with death and rebirth and ash with life and oak with strength.

On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.\n\nThe creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.\n\nSacred Plants and Wood\n\nA druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.\n\nSimilarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.\n\nDruids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.\n\nDruids and the Gods\n\nSome druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.\n\nFighter\n\nClass Features\n\nAs a fighter, you gain the following class features.\n\nHit Points\n\nHit Dice: 1d10 per fighter level\n\nHit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your Constitution modifier\n\nHit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per fighter level after 1st\n\nProficiencies\n\nArmor: All armor, shields\n\nWeapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons\n\nTools: None\n\nSaving Throws: Strength, Constitution\n\nSkills: Choose two skills from Acrobatics, Animal\n\nHandling, Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, and Survival\n\nEquipment\n\nYou start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:\n- (a) chain mail or (b) leather armor, longbow, and 20 arrows\n- (a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons\n- (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) two handaxes\n- (a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack\n\nThe Fighter\n\nLevel Proficiency Bonus Features 1st +2 Fighting Style, Second Wind 2nd +2 Action Surge (one use) 3rd +2 Martial Archetype 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 5th +3 Extra Attack 6th +3 Ability Score Improvement 7th +3 Martial Archetype Feature 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 9th +4 Indomitable (one use) 10th +4 Martial Archetype Feature 11th +4 Extra Attack (2) 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 13th +5 Indomitable (two uses) 14th +5 Ability Score Improvement 15th +5 Martial Archetype Feature 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 17th +6 Action Surge (two uses), Indomitable (three uses) 18th +6 Martial Archetype Feature 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 20th +6 Extra Attack (3)\n\nFighting Style\n\nYou adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty.
