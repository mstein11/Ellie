What are the different arcane traditions in wizardry and how do they affect a wizard's study and spellcasting abilities?,"['Wizard\n======\nArcane Traditions\n-----------------\n\nThe study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.\n\nThe most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.\n\n'
 'Wizard\n======\nArcane Traditions\n-----------------\n### School of Evocation\n\nYou focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.\n\n#### Evocation Savant\n\nBeginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.\n\n'
 'Wizard\n======\nClass Features\n--------------\n### Arcane Recovery\n\nYou have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.\n\nFor example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.\n\n### Arcane Tradition\n\nWhen you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.\n\nYour choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.\n\n'
 'Wizard\n======\nArcane Traditions\n-----------------\n### Your Spellbook\n\nThe spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.\n\n***Copying a Spell into the Book.*** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.\n\nCopying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.\n\n'
 'Spellcasting\n============\nCasting a Spell\n---------------\n### The Schools of Magic\n**Evocation** spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.\n\n**Illusion** spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.\n\n**Necromancy** spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.\n\nCreating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as *animate dead* is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.\n\n']","The most common arcane traditions in wizardry are the schools of magic. These traditions categorize spells into eight different schools. Wizards who study these traditions can specialize in a specific school, such as the School of Illusion or the School of Enchantment. The different arcane traditions affect a wizard's study and spellcasting abilities by providing unique benefits and features. For example, the School of Evocation focuses on elemental effects and allows wizards to create pockets of safety within their spells. Other traditions, such as the School of Abjuration or the School of Divination, offer different abilities and advantages to wizards who specialize in them. These arcane traditions provide a framework for wizards to learn and master different techniques and spells.","b""The various arcane traditions in wizardry are divided into eight schools of magic: \n\n1. **Abjuration**\n2. **Conjuration**\n3. **Divination**\n4. **Enchantment**\n5. **Evocation**\n6. **Illusion**\n7. **Necromancy**\n8. **Transmutation**\n\nThese arcane traditions influence a wizard's learning and spellcasting skills in several ways:\n\n- **Focus of Study**: When a wizard reaches 2nd level, they choose an arcane tradition, which shapes their practice of magic. Each school requires mastery of different techniques and spells, directing the wizard's research and spellcasting focus.\n\n- **Class Features**: Each arcane tradition grants specific features at 2nd level and additional benefits at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels. This allows wizards to enhance their abilities and specialize in a particular style of magic.\n\n- **Spell Acquisition**: The spells added to a wizard's spellbook reflect the arcane research and breakthroughs related to their chosen school. This specialization can streamline the process of learning spells, such as the **Evocation Savant** feature, which halves the cost and time to copy evocation spells into their spellbook.\n\nOverall, these traditions not only define the types of spells a wizard can focus on but also influence their development and skills as spellcasters throughout their journey.""",0.99999999998,0.9047619047619048,0.9070343584771724,1.0

For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.\n- You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a *wish* spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.'

 'Using Ability Scores\n====================\nUsing Each Ability\n------------------\n### Dexterity\n#### Hiding\n***Passive Perception.*** When you hide, there’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren’t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.\n\n***What Can You See?*** One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be **lightly** or **heavily obscured**, as explained in chapter 8, “Adventuring.”\n\n'

Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.\n\nIn combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you.

You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective.

When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.\n\nThe Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.\n\n##### Celtic Deities\n\n'
