"What happens when the spell ""Conjure Woodland Beings"" is cast using higher-level spell slots?","[' creatures as a group, which has its own turns.

Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and speak only in gibberish. A greater restoration spell cast on you ends this effect.\n\nOn a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The GM answers each question with one word, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or “unclear” (if the entity doesn’t know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the GM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.\n\nContagion\n\n5th-level necromancy\n\nCasting Time: 1 action\n\nRange: Touch\n\nComponent: V, S\n\nDuration: 7 days\n\nYour touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, you afflict the creature with a disease of your choice from any of the ones described below.\n\nAt the end of each of the target’s turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. After failing three of these saving throws, the disease’s effects last for the duration, and the creature stops making these saves. After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the creature recovers from the disease, and the spell ends.\n\nSince this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease’s effects apply to it.\n\nBlinding Sickness. Pain grips the creature’s mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.\n\nFilth Fever.

"What does the spell ""See Invisibility"" allow you to do?","[' observed.\n\nKnowledge Save Modifier Secondhand (you have heard of the target) +5 Firsthand (you have met the target) +0 Familiar (you know the target well) −5\n\nConnection Save Modifier Likeness or picture −2 Possession or garment −4 Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like −10\n\nOn a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and you can’t use this spell against it again for 24 hours.\n\nOn a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.\n\nInstead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn’t move.\n\nSecret Chest\n\n4th-level conjuration\n\nCasting Time: 1 action\n\nRange: Touch\n\nComponents: V, S, M (an exquisite chest, 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet, constructed from rare materials worth at least 5,000 gp, and a Tiny replica made from the same materials worth at least 50 gp)\n\nDuration: Instantaneous\n\nYou hide a chest, and all its contents, on the Ethereal Plane. You must touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material component for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).\n\nWhile the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica.\n\nAfter 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the spell’s effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell again, if the smaller replica chest is destroyed, or if you choose to end the spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger chest is on the Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.\n\nSee Invisibility\n\n2nd-level divination\n\nCasting Time: 1 action\n\nRange: Self\n\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of powdered silver)\n\nDuration: 1 hour\n\nFor the duration, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.\n\nSeeming\n\n5th-level illusion\n\nCasting Time: 1 action\n\nRange: 30 feet\n\nComponents: V, S\n\nDuration: 8 hours\n\nThis spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.\n\nThe spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change a target’s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.\n\nThe changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature’s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature’s head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.\n\nA creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.\n\nSending\n\n3rd-level evocation\n\nCasting Time: 1 action\n\nRange: Unlimited\n\nComponents: V, S, M (a short piece of fine copper wire)\n\nDuration: 1 round\n\nYou send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar.

Anything else that touches the sphere but isn’t wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.\n\nThe sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.\n\nIf you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature’s control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature’s Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.\n\nIf the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the gate spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a portable hole, the GM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.\n\nd100 Result 01–50 The sphere is destroyed. 51–85 The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space. 86–00 A spatial rift sends each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere, including the sphere, to a random plane of existence.\n\nStaff of Charming\n\nStaff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)\n\nWhile holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 10 charges to cast charm person, command, or comprehend languages from it using your spell save DC.
