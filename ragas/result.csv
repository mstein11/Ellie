What are the different arcane traditions in wizardry and how do they affect a wizard's study and spellcasting abilities?,"['The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.'
 '### Signature Spells\n\nWhen you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\nIf you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.\n\nArcane Traditions\n-----------------\n\nThe study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.'
 '### Spellcasting\n\nAs a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.\n\n#### Cantrips\n\nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.\n\n#### Spellbook\n\nAt 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st- level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.'
 '### Arcane Recovery\n\nYou have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.\n\nFor example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.\n\n### Arcane Tradition\n\nWhen you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.\n\nYour choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.'
 '### The Schools of Magic\n\nAcademies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.\n\nThe schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.\n\n**Abjuration** spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.\n\n**Conjuration** spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.']","The most common arcane traditions in wizardry are the schools of magic. These traditions categorize spells into eight different schools. Wizards who study these traditions can specialize in a specific school, such as the School of Illusion or the School of Enchantment. The different arcane traditions affect a wizard's study and spellcasting abilities by providing unique benefits and features. For example, the School of Evocation focuses on elemental effects and allows wizards to create pockets of safety within their spells. Other traditions, such as the School of Abjuration or the School of Divination, offer different abilities and advantages to wizards who specialize in them. These arcane traditions provide a framework for wizards to learn and master different techniques and spells.","b""The various arcane traditions in wizardry are Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, and Transmutation. Each tradition shapes a wizard's practice of magic by focusing on a specific school of magic. For example, a wizard specializing in Abjuration will excel in protective spells, while a wizard specializing in Evocation will be skilled in spells that deal damage.\n\nBy choosing an arcane tradition, a wizard gains features at 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level that enhance their abilities related to that school of magic. This specialization allows a wizard to learn and cast spells more effectively within their chosen tradition, making them more powerful in that particular area of magic.""",0.8874999999778125,1.0,0.9690453343779315,0.7142857142857143
What spells can a Tiefling cast as part of their Infernal Legacy trait?,"['***Infernal Legacy.*** You know the *thaumaturgy* cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the *hellish rebuke* spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the *darkness* spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.\n\n***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal.\nBarbarian\n=========\n\nClass Features\n--------------\n\nAs a barbarian, you gain the following class features.'
 'In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you cast this spell).\n\nWhen you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the spell.\n\nThe spell’s area can’t overlap with the area of another *forbiddance* spell. If you cast *forbiddance* every day for 30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material components are consumed on the last casting.'
 '### Special Traits\n\nSpecial traits (which appear after a monster’s challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.\n\n#### Innate Spellcasting\n\nA monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and can’t be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster’s challenge rating.\n\nAn innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a drow mage can innately cast the *levitate* spell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction, which means that the spell affects only the drow mage.\n\nA monster’s innate spells can’t be swapped out with other spells. If a monster’s innate spells don’t require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.'
 '### Tiefling Traits\n\nTieflings share certain racial traits as a result of their infernal descent.\n\n***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.\n\n***Age.*** Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer.\n\n***Alignment.*** Tieflings might not have an innate tendency toward evil, but many of them end up there. Evil or not, an independent nature inclines many tieflings toward a chaotic alignment.\n\n***Size.*** Tieflings are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium.\n\n***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\n***Darkvision.*** Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\n***Hellish Resistance.*** You have resistance to fire damage.'
 'When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\n\n***Death.*** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.\n\n***Discord.*** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.']","The Tiefling can cast the thaumaturgy cantrip, the hellish rebuke spell as a 2nd-level spell, and the darkness spell once as part of their Infernal Legacy trait.","b""The spells included in a Tiefling's Infernal Legacy trait are *thaumaturgy*, *hellish rebuke*, and *darkness*.""",0.999999999975,1.0,0.9786511615773102,1.0

In addition, when you fall, you descend 60 feet per round and take no damage from falling. You can also speak and understand Auran.']","The feature associated with the keyphrase ""Elemental Affinity"" in the Warlock class is that when a warlock casts a spell that deals damage of the type associated with their patron's expanded spell list, they can add their Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.","b'The feature linked to the keyphrase ""Elemental Affinity"" in the Warlock class is the Pact of the Chain feature.'",0.3333333333,0.0,0.9914186385860612,0.0

 '### Path of the Berserker\n\nFor some barbarians, rage is a means to an end— that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.\n\n#### Frenzy\n\nStarting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one.

 '### Pact Magic\n\nYour arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.\n\n#### Cantrips\n\nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.\n\n#### Spell Slots\n\nThe Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nFor example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell *thunderwave*, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.'

They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.\n\nIf you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.'

 '#### The Celtic Pantheon\n\nIt’s said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak—and it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from the brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.\n\nThe Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.'

Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).'

You otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.\n\nYou can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.\n\nYou choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action’s timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.']","The Bandit Captain has the following abilities and actions: Armor Class 15 (studded leather), Hit Points 65 (10d8 + 20), Speed 30 ft., STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 15 (+2) 16 (+3) 14 (+2) 14 (+2) 11 (+0) 14 (+2), Saving Throws Str +4, Dex +5, Wis +2, Skills Athletics +4, Deception +4, Senses passive Perception 10, Languages any two languages, Challenge 2 (450 XP), Actions: Multiattack.
