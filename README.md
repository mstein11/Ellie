# Elminster-GPT: Open Source Dungeons & Dragons AI Chatbot

![](public/readme-banner.png)

Elminster-GPT is an open-source AI chatbot developed using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, tailored specifically for the Dungeons & Dragons universe through the usage of the content from the System Reference Document (SRD). This chatbot is designed to assist new players in familiarizing themselves with the intricate game mechanics of Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition (5e).

**Getting Started**: To interact with Elminster-GPT, visit https://elminster-gpt.vercel.app/ and pose your questions. The chatbot leverages D&D SRD content to provide accurate responses, displaying the source paragraph from the SRD on the right side of the screen for reference.
